* phoebe's dotfiles
  yeah lamo it's a dotfile repo what more is there to say.
** install
   #+begin_src sh
     sh install.sh
   #+end_src
   note that script inspects ~$(pwd)~ in order to symlink files by absolute path, so you
   have to be in this directory to run it! no ~cd ~; sh path/to/dotfiles/install.sh~!
